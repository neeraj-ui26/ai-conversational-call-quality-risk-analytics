EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
AI Conversational Call Quality & Risk Analytics

This project demonstrates how conversational AI systems can be monitored, evaluated, and operationally prioritized in real production environments using SQL and Power BI. 
The system is built on 10,000+ synthetic AI call interactions and tracks volume, error penetration, latency behavior (P50/P90), cascading failures, and operational risk 
across the full AI call lifecycle.

The solution goes beyond basic reporting by introducing a quality degradation funnel, error frequency and impact analysis, co-occurrence patterns, and a weighted risk scoring
 model. This allows operations and quality teams to move from reactive reporting to proactive prioritization of the most business-critical AI failures.

The outcome is an AI Ops–ready decision system that enables early detection of reliability drift, targeted manual review instead of full QA coverage, and data-backed prioritization 
of model and process improvements.

This project is designed as a public, executive-grade portfolio artifact for AI Ops Analyst, Conversational AI Analyst, Operations Analyst, and Quality & Risk roles, with a strong
focus on production monitoring, reliability, and business impact rather than model development.
